<h1>About</h1>

<div id="profile_picture"></div>

<p>This website is my personal space to document some of my more nerdy and
technologically involved projects. This is the long-anticipated split from my
"main" personal blog at <a href="https://heipei.net">heipei.net</a>, which I'll
try to keep up to date as well.</p>

<p>For this blog I've chosen the Jekyll static page generator. It's still not pure
unfiltered HTML and CSS but a lot more to my liking than Wordpress and
in-browser editing.</p>
