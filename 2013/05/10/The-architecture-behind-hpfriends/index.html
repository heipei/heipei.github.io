	<h1>The architecture behind hpfriends</h1>
	<p class="meta">10 May 2013</p>
	<p><em>Abstract</em>: In this post, readers will gain some insight into the architecture of the
<a href="https://hpfriends.honeycloud.net">hpfriends</a> platform. Users who want to learn how to use hpfriends should have a look
at the guide on <a href="/2013/05/11/Using-hpfriends-the-social-data-sharing-platform">using hpfriends</a>.</p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rep/hpfeeds">hpfeeds</a> is a simple publish/subscribe data sharing model. It was initially created by
<a href="https://twitter.com/repmovsb">Mark ‘rep’ Schloesser</a> as a way to carry high-volume real-time data from different pieces
of honeypot software between members of the Honeynet project. hpfriends is an evolution of the hpfeeds data sharing
model. It uses the same wire protocol and thus maintains backwards-compatibility with all data sources / sinks.</p>

<p>However, instead of relying on access authorization based on channels, hpfriends uses a social graph in order to make
sharing data even easier and more natural. This also circumvents some policy issues about which people should be able to
use hpfeeds and who should be allowed onto which channels.</p>

<h1 id="architecture-a-namearchnbspa">Architecture <a name="arch"> </a></h1>

<p>Channels in hpfeeds are commonly used to group data of the same origin and structure. A channel dedicated to data from
the dionaea honeypot software can be expected to carry data adherring to a specific format, suitable for automated
processing. Before hpfriends, channel names were unique and global within the hpfeeds system. This meant that once a
channel was established by a user (such as <code>dionaea.captures</code>), that user had to grant permission each time another user
wanted to publish or subscribe to the channel <code>dionaea.captures</code>.</p>

<h2 id="hpfriends">hpfriends</h2>

<p>hpfriends uses a social sharing graph as its backend database. That means that users and groups are represented as
<em>nodes</em>, while the sharing relationships are modelled as <em>edges</em> between those nodes. Sharing is no binary attribute,
which is why each edge contains a number of attributes, such as the type of the relationship and the channel name.</p>

<p><img src="/images/graph.png" alt="hpfriends graph" title="hpfriends graph" />
<br /><small>A (very small) subset of the hpfriends sharing graph.</small></p>

<p>Channels are no longer global broadcast rooms but rather local decisions. For each message on a channel and user node, a
decision is made whether the channel can be accessed by other users based on the existence of a sharing relationship
between the original user and other users and groups. Since a channel name can be used by anyone to publish messages,
channels have de-facto become exclusive mandatory tags for messages.</p>

<p>If user <strong>jojo</strong> has a sharing relationship on channel <code>dionaea.captures</code> with user <strong>mark</strong>, then <em>mark</em> will be able
to read messages on that channel. Other user groups might also use the channel name <code>dionaea.captures</code>, yet have no
sharing relationships with <strong>jojo</strong> or <strong>mark</strong>. User <strong>mark</strong> may in turn decide to also share his <code>dionaea.captures</code>
messages with <strong>jojo</strong>, or even re-distribute the messages he received from <strong>jojo</strong> to third parties, i.e. other users
and groups.  The difference between sharing only messages generated by the user or also incoming messages by other users
is indicated using the <code>type</code> attribute.</p>

<h2 id="groups">Groups</h2>

<p>Groups are used to address a number of people without having to establish sharing relationsships with each individual
member. In our database, groups a represented as nodes which have an edge to each member.</p>

<h2 id="authkeys">Authkeys</h2>

<p>hpfriends uses Authkeys in the same fashion as the hpfeeds system. In fact, the hpfriends message broker is
backwards-compatible to the hpfeeds tools. Authkeys are used as single-purpose tokens for different pieces of backend
software which is needed to publish and subscribe to data-channels. Each Authkey has a list of channels it’s allowed to
publish and subscribe to.</p>

<h1 id="implementation">Implementation</h1>

<p>The hpfriends system is still very much work-in-progress, which is why the implementation details are subject to change.</p>

<p>The sharing graph was realized with the <a href="https://www.neo4j.org/">Neo4j</a> database, an Open-Source graph-database
implemented in Java. Although Neo4j enables very efficient graph storage and operations it does have a few quirks.
Concerning hpfeeds, it is obviously quite impractical and unnecessary to do a lookup on the sharing graph for each new
message on a channel. Instead, we traverse the graph if the sharing relationships change and save the sharing attributes
in a flat format afterwars.</p>

<p>For the web frontend we decided to go with the <a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a> JavaScript framework. Meteor is still
being developed with frequent significant changes. But it enabled us to create a relatively simple real-time web
application without having to worry about a lot of aspects. We chose to stick with the <a href="https://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/">Twitter
Bootstrap</a> HTML/CSS framework for the visual elements.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/rep/hpfeeds">reference implementation for hpfeeds</a> was done in Python, but there are projects to
bring hpfeeds support to <a href="https://github.com/fw42/go-hpfeeds">Go</a> and <a href="https://github.com/fw42/hpfeedsrb">Ruby</a>. If you
are using these projects consider contributing patches or feedback.</p>
